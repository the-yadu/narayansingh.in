      When I started my journey as a developer, the web was a very different place. Over the years, I’ve seen technologies come and go, but the fundamentals of building great products have remained the same: empathy, curiosity, and a drive to solve real problems.
    </p>
    <h2 class="font-bold mt-8 mb-2">1. Embrace Change</h2>
    <p>
      The tech landscape evolves rapidly. Don’t be afraid to learn new frameworks or languages. Each new tool is an opportunity to grow and see problems from a fresh perspective.
    </p>
    <h2 class="font-bold mt-8 mb-2">2. Focus on the User</h2>
    <p>
      No matter how elegant your code, it’s the user experience that matters most. Talk to your users, test your assumptions, and always strive to make things simpler and more accessible.
    </p>
    <h2 class="font-bold mt-8 mb-2">3. Collaboration is Key</h2>
    <p>
      The best products are built by teams who communicate openly and support each other. Don’t hesitate to ask for help or offer it. Mentoring others has been one of the most rewarding parts of my career.
    </p>
    <h2 class="font-bold mt-8 mb-2">4. Never Stop Learning</h2>
    <p>
      Whether it’s a new technology, a design principle, or a soft skill, continuous learning keeps you adaptable and inspired. Set aside time each week to explore something new.
    </p>
    <h2 class="font-bold mt-8 mb-2">5. Enjoy the Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Building software is as much about the process as the outcome. Celebrate small wins, learn from setbacks, and remember why you started.
